# ajaxProgressBar
AJAX Progress Bar implementation for long running processes

This is a quick and dirty mashup made possible with help from the following resources:
http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/providing-feedback-on-long-running-scripts-in-older-browsers.html
http://cssdeck.com/labs/nice-sparkle-progress-bars

Todo:
* Work for progress bar max values which are not 100.
* Work with a server supplied max value.
* more stuff...
